# Hackathon 2024

The digital twin hackathon 2024 will take place in Göttingen from 7-8 March 2024. Participation is on invite only. 
We are planning to work on the following packages:

- [Neural Predictors](https://github.com/sinzlab/neuralpredictors)
- [MEI](https://github.com/sinzlab/mei)
- [Nexport](https://github.com/sinzlab/nexport) (currently not public)

The focus of this year will be on usability. We would like to improve the packages with the following goals in mind
- Users should be able to teach themselves how to use the package
- The structure and elements of the packages and how they can be used/extended should be clear
- There should be examples showcasing the functionalities of the packages
- Dependencies on internal infrastructure and software should be removed.
